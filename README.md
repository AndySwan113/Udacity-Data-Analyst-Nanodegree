Udacity Data Analyst Nano-degree Projects

Here are the 4 projects that I completed during the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 
Project 1:
Using data from IMDB to analyse the data.
Project 2:
Using statistical techinques for hypothesis testing and regression analysis to draw conclusions.
Project 3:
Wrangling and analysing data that has been gathered from API's and imported manually.
Project 4:
Creating exploratory data visualizations, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Then transforming these into explanatory visualisations to produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered.
